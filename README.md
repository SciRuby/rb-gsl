# Ruby/GSL, a Ruby interface to GSL (GNU Scientific library)

Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document under
the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License.

## Description

Ruby/GSL is a Ruby interface to the [GNU Scientific Library](https://gnu.org/software/gsl/)
(GSL), for numerical computing with [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/).


## Installation

Ruby/GSL may be installed as a Ruby Gem by simply running

  gem install gsl

Note that the GSL libraries must already be installed before Ruby/GSL
can be installed:

Debian/Ubuntu: `libgsl0-dev`
Fedora/SuSE:   `gsl-devel`
Gentoo:        `sci-libs/gsl`
OS X:          <tt>brew install gsl</tt>

It is recommended to install the [GNU plotutils](https://gnu.org/software/plotutils/plotutils.html)
package. Some of the example scripts in the `examples/` directory use the
`graph` utility included in the package to plot the results. Windows cygwin
binaries of <tt>GNU plotutils</tt> and related packages are available
[here](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/plotutils.htm).


## Reference

The [Ruby/GSL reference manual](link:rdoc/ref_rdoc.html) follows and borrows
large parts of the GSL reference manual.


## Examples

See scripts in `examples/` and `test/` directories.
