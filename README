== Description
Ruby/GSL, a ruby interface to GSL (GNU Scientific library), with NMatrix support instead of NArray

== NMatrix Fork
There is a naming conflict between the nmatrix and narray gems: both make use of the global class names NMatrix and
NVector.

SciRuby and its component gem statsample make use of Ruby/GSL, but also increasingly depend on NMatrix. As such, we
needed an NMatrix-specific fork which removed references to NArray, and allowed conversion between GSL and NMatrix data
types.

== Installation

If you want the nmatrix conversions to work, you should probably do as follows before installing GSL:

  gem install nmatrix

=== Installation from Source

  git clone https://github.com/SciRuby/rb-gsl.git
  cd rb-gsl/
  ruby setup.rb config
  ruby setup.rb setup
  ruby setup.rb install # as root

=== Installation from RubyGems

  gem install gsl-nmatrix
